#  Red & White Wine Quality Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes the **chemical properties** and **quality ratings** of red and white wines. Using visual analytics, we explore how features like acidity, alcohol, and residual sugar affect wine quality.

##  Project Objectives

- Compare key attributes of red and white wines.
- Understand how different features correlate with wine quality.
- Identify top contributing factors for high-quality wines.
- Visualize trends for better decision-making and storytelling.

##  Dashboard Features

- **Quality Distribution** of red vs. white wines
- **Top Chemical Properties** that influence taste and rating
- **Correlation Heatmaps** to explore feature relationships
- **Alcohol vs. Quality** trend by wine type
- **Acidity, Sugar, and pH** comparison for both wine types

##  Dataset Details

The dataset comes from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) and contains:

- **Red Wine**: 1,599 observations
- **White Wine**: 4,898 observations
- 11 physicochemical variables (pH, sulphates, citric acid, etc.)
- 1 sensory quality score (0–10)

> The file used: `Red and White wine Project.xlsx`

##  Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel** (Data cleaning and visualization)
- **Power BI** (For building interactive dashboards)
- **Python** *(optional extension for data preprocessing and analysis)*

##  Insights

- **White wine** generally has higher residual sugar and lower alcohol than red wine.
- **Alcohol content** is positively correlated with quality for both wine types.
- **Volatile acidity** negatively impacts wine quality.
- Red wines show stronger acidity profiles, while white wines are sweeter.
